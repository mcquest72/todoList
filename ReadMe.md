# Todo List app

This is a simple webapp that keeps track of task you are to complete.

The exercise of writing this code was a little bit challenging since, am still at my infantry stage of javascript.

Thank God, I was able to understand some basic concepts as I proceeded with hands on experience.

I wish to appreciate my mentor [@katfogy](https://github.com/katfogy) for his support, He has been a great inspirator.
